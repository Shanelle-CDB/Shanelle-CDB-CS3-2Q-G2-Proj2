            <h1>Defining Cyberbullying and its Relevance in Modern Society</h1>
            <h3>By Louise Felicio</h3>
            <p>Have you ever been a victim of or partaken in cyberbullying? First, let us define 
                what it is. What is cyberbullying? Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that happens 
                on digital platforms, such as social media, chatting apps, online forums, and gaming 
                communities. Cyberbullying involves using digital tools to harm, intimidate, or humiliate 
                someone. For example, posting or sending messages, photos, or videos with the intent to 
                hurt someone is considered as cyberbullying. Leaking someone’s private information, pictures, 
                or videos without their consent also qualifies as cyberbullying and is considered a crime and 
                is punishable under the law. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2024). </p>

            <p>What makes cyberbullying dangerous is its accessibility, through the internet and gadgets, it can 
                happen anytime, anywhere. Unlike traditional bullying, where victims can often escape their bullies
                by leaving a physical space, like work or school, cyberbullying invades their private lives, making 
                it nearly inescapable. Additionally, it can have a long-lasting impact on the victim and other people
                because harmful content shared online can reach a huge viewer count quickly.</p>

            <p>Anyone can be a victim of cyberbullying, regardless of their age, social status, or background. According 
                to UNICEF Philippines (2019), data shows that cyberbullying affects a significant portion of teenagers. 
                44% of Filipino males aged 13-17 have experienced or are still experiencing cyberviolence, with the females 
                not being far off with 43%. With the growing use of technology and social media, cyberbullying has become a 
                relatively worsening and concerning issue. Understanding what it is and its examples is the first step to 
                addressing and fighting against it.</p>
