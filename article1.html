            <h1>Defining Cyberbullying and its Relevance in Modern Society</h1>
            <h3>By Louise Felicio</h3>
            <p>Have you ever been a victim of or partaken in cyberbullying? First, 
                let us define what it is. What is cyberbullying? Cyberbullying is 
                a form of bullying that happens on digital platforms, such as social 
                media, chatting apps, online forums, and gaming communities. Cyberbullying 
                involves using digital tools to harm, intimidate, or humiliate someone. 
                For example, posting or sending messages, photos, or videos with the intent to 
                hurt someone is considered as cyberbullying. Leaking someoneâ€™s private information, 
                pictures, or videos without their consent also qualifies as cyberbullying and is 
                considered a crime and is punishable under the law. </p>

            <p>What makes cyberbullying dangerous is its accessibility, through the internet 
                and gadgets, it can happen anytime, anywhere. Unlike traditional bullying, 
                where victims can often escape their bullies by leaving a physical space, like 
                work or school, cyberbullying invades their private lives, making it nearly inescapable. 
                Additionally, it can have a long-lasting impact on the victim and other people because 
                harmful content shared online can reach a huge viewer count quickly. </p>

            <p>Anyone can be a victim of cyberbullying, regardless of their age, social status, or 
                background. According to UNICEF Philippines( 2019), data shows that cyberbullying 
                affects a significant portion of teenagers. 44% of Filipino males aged 13-17 have 
                experienced or are still experiencing cyberviolence, with the females not being far 
                off with 43%. With the growing use of technology and social media, cyberbullying has 
                become a relatively worsening and concerning issue. Understanding what it is and its 
                examples is the first step to addressing and fighting against it.</p>
