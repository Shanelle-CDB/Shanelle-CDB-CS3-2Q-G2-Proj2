            <h1>The Devastating Impact of Cyberbullying</h1>
            <h3>By Hyzah Shin Abdulkadil</h3>
            <p>Cyberbullying, which happens online, has been getting worse, especially for kids and teenagers. 
                The COVID-19 pandemic worsened it because more people were using the internet. Cyberbullying 
                occurs when someone says mean things, spreads lies, or tries to hurt someone’s feelings on purpose 
                online. It can make people feel sad, lonely, or like they aren’t good enough. While we know regular 
                bullying can hurt people, we don’t know as much about how cyberbullying can make someone feel so sad 
                that they might want to hurt themselves. Unfortunately, there have been cases where cyberbullying has 
                led to people taking their own lives, showing how serious the problem is.</p>

            <p> According to Ariel Schonfeld, et. al. (2023), "The incidences of both cyberbullying and adolescent suicide 
                are rising in the United States, with recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing that 
                14.9 percent of adolescents have been cyberbullied and 13.6 percent of adolescents have made a serious suicide 
                attempt." This shows that cyberbullying is becoming a bigger problem for kids. When children are bullied online, 
                they can feel unfortunate, and lonely, and believe they aren’t good enough. Some kids feel so hopeless because of 
                this bullying that they think about hurting themselves. In some cases, kids have even taken their own lives because 
                of the pain, which is now called "cyberbullicide." This is why it’s so important to stop cyberbullying and help 
                those who are struggling. </p>

            <p>When a child dies because of cyberbullying, parents feel a deep, painful sadness and often blame themselves. They 
                wonder if they missed signs or could have done something differently to protect their child. The loss is overwhelming,
                and they are left with many questions that may never be answered. This grief lasts a lifetime, and the impact is felt
                in every part of their lives. Losing a child to something like cyberbullying shows just how serious the effects can be, 
                and how much it can hurt a child’s mental and emotional health.</p>

            <p>Cyberbullying is increasing, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's impacting kids and teens negatively. Victims 
                often feel sad, and lonely, and sometimes think about self-harm or suicide. Studies show rising rates of both cyberbullying 
                and suicide among adolescents. When a child dies from cyberbullying, parents are left with overwhelming grief and guilt. 
                This highlights the importance of understanding the serious effects cyberbullying can have on children’s mental health.</p>
