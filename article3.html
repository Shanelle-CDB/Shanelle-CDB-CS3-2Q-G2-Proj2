            <h1>Breaking the Silence: Creating a Secure Online Environment to Stop Cyberbullying</h1>
            <h3>By Jhielou Marie Mamaradlo</h3>
            <p>When bullying happens online, it can feel like you're being attacked 
            everywhere, even at home. There could appear to be no escape route. 
            The most typical symptoms of cyberbullying include insecurity and 
            obsessive thoughts about what other people think or say about your 
            entire life, including what you do, say, publish, or look like. 
            Victims may also start to feel ashamed and anxious. Generally speaking, 
            all of these result in negative thoughts and the beginning of self-talk, 
            social isolation, guilt regarding deeds or inactions, or a feeling of 
            unfavorable judgment. Cyberbullying typically harms a victim's attendance 
            and academic performance, especially if the victim is a student. This is 
            especially true if the bullying happens both in person and online, the 
            victim needs to speak up about this issue. Because of the stress and mental 
            pain caused by cyberbullying, kids and teens may resort to unhealthy coping 
            strategies including substance abuse. As demonstrated by the fact that, in the 
            worst cases, ongoing harassment can lead to suicidal thoughts or thoughts of 
            self-harm, which can ultimately result in death, and its effects can be disastrous 
            both to the victim and the victim's family.</p>

            <p>We now utilize social media regularly, which frequently leads to more sudden instances of 
            cyberbullying. Particularly in the current generation, it is crucial to understand certain 
            tactics for stopping and preventing cyberbullying, as this is our shared responsibility.  
            To tackle cyberbullying, governments, families, schools, and individuals must collaborate. 
            An essential first step is education. Young people may stop bullying by learning about empathy 
            and most importantly internet etiquette, and the repercussions of their online behavior. 
            In this topic, parents and guardians are also very crucial once it's educating their children’s 
            about these as they are the first teachers and a reflection of their children’s actions and behavior 
            whether in real life or online. If there is an open discussion about their experiences, a safe place 
            where children who are being bullied online could be more comfortable speaking up and monitoring online 
            activities without becoming overly intrusive might help strike a balance between privacy protection and 
            safety which leads to a peaceful and safe online environment to anyone and everyone around the globe.</p>

            <p>In the end, stopping cyberbullying is essential, though it requires a lot such as a culture of empathy,
            accountability, and cooperation these things can help make our online world a better and safer place. 
            By promoting empathy, respect and imbuing the core values of netiquette as being a digital netizen we 
            can create a safer environment where everyone feels valued and protected. The first step in combating 
            cyberbullying is again, for every one of us to take accountability and think about the consequences of 
            what we say or do to others. It is a collective issue rather than just a personal one. Together, we can 
            build a kind and upbeat online community where nobody has to face the pain of cyberbullying alone.</p>
